# Binary Tree Terminology

[Geek for Geek Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/)

## Binary meaning and BST Rules
- only have two children
  - left and right
- Children are actually trees themselves
- Left subtree
  - contains only nodes that are less than the parent
- Right subtree
  - contains only nodes that are greater then the parent

## Root
- top most of the tree

## Child
- a node directly connects to another node
- moves *away* from root

## Parent
- a node directly connects to another node
- moves *towards* the root

## Siblings
- nodes that share the same parent

## Leaf
- node without any children of its own
- the last node in the chain


# Pros and Cons of Binary Search Trees

## Pros
- searching for elements is significantly more efficient vs array/linked list
  
## Cons
- not as efficient to insert elements into
- performance depends on balance of the tree
  - balance is in meaning of height of tree
